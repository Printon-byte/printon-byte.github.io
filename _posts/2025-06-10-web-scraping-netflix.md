## 🕸️ Introduction

As part of my data science learning journey, I tackled a web scraping assignment to collect Netflix data. The goal was to fetch structured information from a webpage and prepare it for analysis.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pandas

## 🛠️ The Process

I targeted a publicly available Netflix dataset and used `requests` to fetch the HTML, and `BeautifulSoup` to parse it.

 Takeaways
Learned how to extract structured data from HTML

Gained experience working with messy real-world web structures

This project laid the groundwork for deeper data extraction and ETL workflows.
