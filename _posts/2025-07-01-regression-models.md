In Week 7, I dove into **regression analysis** using Python to predict continuous variables based on feature inputs.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Lasso and Ridge Regression

---

## ðŸ’» Sample Code

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("RÂ² Score:", model.score(X_test, y_test))
