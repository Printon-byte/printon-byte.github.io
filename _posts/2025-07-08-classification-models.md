In Week 8, I explored **classification algorithms** to predict categories (e.g., spam/not spam, churn/no churn).

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines

---

## ðŸ’» Sample Code

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Accuracy:", clf.score(X_test, y_test))
