Hello, I’m **Printon Mauda Oduki**, a passionate data enthusiast with a background in **Statistics** and a growing skillset in **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

I earned my **BSc in Statistics** from **Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology**, where I developed a strong foundation in data analysis, probability, and predictive modeling.

Over the past few months and year, I’ve explored:
- **Web scraping** with Python to collect and analyze real-world data  
- **Data wrangling** to clean and prepare datasets for deeper insights  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib  
- **Business Intelligence (BI)** tools like Power BI for storytelling and dashboard creation  
- And now, I'm diving into **machine learning and AI applications** to build smarter, data-driven systems

Beyond data, I have a passion for **creativity, structure, and impact**—whether that’s through visual storytelling or building tools that make decision-making easier.

Feel free to explore my [projects](/projects/) or connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/printon-byte).

Thanks for stopping by.
